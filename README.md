# About Me
Hey! Thanks for checking out my profile. My name is Josh, and I'm currently working as a growth engineer at [webapp.io](https://webapp.io) (YC S20). I love all things entrepreneurship related, fitness (love me some powerlifting), and overall just being outdoors.

I personally work a lot with JavaScript (React, Express, and all that fancy stuff). My go-to stack is React & Express, with a MySQL database - but I'm comfortable working with other things too (just takes me some time to learn). 


## Things I've Built:
- [Pimp My ReadMe](https://pimp-my-readme.webapp.io) - Open source project that you can use to pimp our your read me (add in some cool components like the ones on this readme).
**If you'd like to contribute check out this repo [Pimp My ReadMe](https://github.com/joshdsouza8/pimp-my-readme)**

- [Phros](https://phros.ca) - Giving health & fitness instructors the tools to grow online.

- [CloudSafari](https://mycloudsafari.com) - Marketplace to connect travellers to local tour companies in Africa (built this just before covid started lol).

**I'm open to feedback on anything, so reach out to me if you have some suggestions :)**
